database: an organized collection of data  
database management system(DBMS): a software system that *stores*, *manages*, and *facilitates access* to one or more databases.

Python analysis ---- Query(SQL commands) ---- DBMS Server  
DBMS server ---- Response(tables showed on our screen) --- Python analysis
