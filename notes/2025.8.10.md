## Lecture 18: Estimators, Bias, and Variance  

Model Risk = Irreducible error + Model Variance + (Model Bias)**2

Think: the expectation is over what? noise? different samples? different data points to be predicted?

bias, variance tradeoff; sweet point  


##  Lecture 19: Parameter Inference and Bootstrap

parallel universe  

prediction: the outcome, pursue accuracy  
inference: 'Why?'

Collinearity  
Causal Domain Knowledge  
Collinearity causes high variance, which does not harm predictive performance but does harm the validity of a certain parameter as a measure of the association between X and Y. (think of two vectors have the same direction!)
