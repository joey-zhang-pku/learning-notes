### 3. What about pictures?  

step1: store the target picture in our machine, it will have a path, or we can have an online picture, which will have a url.
step2: create a folder in our repo for exclusively pictures.
step3: use markdown insert our picture into text file(the notes). Attention: we need relative path here, while the repo and our picture are fixed, there's no confusion that the relative path should point from repo's location to our picture's location

###  4. princple for git woroks  
always keep my remote and local repos sychronized, so you won't oversrite or lose work.  

### 5.local repo  

While creating a remote repo in github is easy, creata a local repo is trickier. We can clone our remote repo.

### 6. Summarize the errors and problems  

We wanna interact between local repo nd remote repo, which means the single file on the desktop won't help, updates on that won't count.
